		<p>The very first principle of animation is Squash and Stretch.</p>

		<p>It involves an item squashing on impact or pressure, and stretching when moving rapidly. This helps make an animation feel more lifelike and dynamic, and less stiff and artificial. Squash and Stretch is an extremely fundemental part of animation and is used very often, even in places where you don't think about, such as the background or even slightly in characters accessories or body parts. It can even be used to help exaggerate a character's facial expressions. </p>

		<p>You'll notice that the ball on the left feels stiff and lifeless. It's just a ball going up and down.</p>

		<p>But, you'll notice that the ball on the right is more of an animation. It's more dynamic and lifelike and has more character, because that ball is using Squash and Stretch, while the ball on the left is not. This is an example how Squash and Stretch can give life to an animation.</p>

		<p> As you can see here, Squash and Stretch is very useful for exaggerating expression and head movement. With this principle alone, you can give so much life and character to an animation to one that would otherwise feel stiff, dead and too realistic. </p>
