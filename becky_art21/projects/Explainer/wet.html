	<h1>Insructions:</h1>
		<p>Grab a small pot and fill it with water, in between your <br> first and middle knuckle on your pointer finger <br> NoteL the package usually requires way too much water!</p>
		<br>
		<p>Put the pot on stove and crank the heat up to HIGH!</p>
		<br>
		<p>While boiling the water, you can prep other ingredients. <br> If you have green onion, chop it up</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you have frozen dumplings or fishcakes, <br> you can add it in now</p>
		<br>
		<p>Note: Some people like to crack their <br>noodle block in half for eash of eating! <br> Once the water is boiling, add your <br> seasoning packet, dried vegetables, and noodles. <br> If you want to add rice cakes, add them in now!</p>
		<br>
		<p>Leave the heat on high and let the noodles cook</p>
		<br>
		<p>Test the noodles every minute or so. <br> Once they hit a little bit before al dente, <br> crack in your egg and gently cover it with your noodles! <br> Then cover your pot with a lid and turn <br> the heat down to medium</p>
		<br>
		<p>Count for 40 seconds (including the Mississippi's!) <br> Then quickly add your green onions! <br> If you decide to add cheese, <br> throw it on top right before you add green onions!</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you wanted to add boiled eggs, add them now! <br> Cover your pot with a lid and take it off the heat</p>
		<br>
		<p>Enjoy!</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Recommended:</strong> Eating straight from the pot! <br> <strong>Recommended:</strong> Make it a goal to finish your ramen within 15 min! <br> The noodles can get super soggy, <br> which can ruin the eating experience for a lot of people</p>
