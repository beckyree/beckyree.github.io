	<h1>Insructions:</h1>
		<p>(Optional) Fry up an egg :D</p>
		<br>
		<p>Grab a small pot and fill it with water. <br> The amount doesn't necessarily matter, but <br> enough to approximately cover the noodles</p>
		<br>
		<p>Put the pot on stove and crank the heat up to HIGH!</p>
		<br>
		<p>Once the water boils, put in the noodle block <br> and dried vegetables (only if they are included)</p>
		<br>
		<p>Test the noodles every minute or so, <br> and once the noodles hit al dente DRAIN THE WATER!!! <br> Note: While it is recommended that around two tablespoons <br> of water are to be left in the pot, that isn't really important</p>
		<br>
		<p>Turn off the heat and bring you pot (with your noodles) <br> back and stir in your sauce packet</p>
		<br>
		<p>Add your fried egg/foods on top!</p>
		<br>
		<p>Enjoy!</p>
